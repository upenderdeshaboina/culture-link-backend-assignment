# Product Value Calculator API

This is a simple REST API built with Node.js, Express, and SQLite. It allows users to calculate the total value of a list of products and store each product's details in a database. This project includes environment management with `dotenv` and enables cross-origin requests with `cors`.

## Features
- **Calculate Total Product Value**: Accepts a list of products, calculates the total price, and returns the total value.
- **Store Product Information**: Saves product information (name, price, and quantity) in a SQLite database.
- **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**: Enabled to allow requests from different origins.

## Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: Make sure Node.js is installed. Download it [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- **SQLite**: SQLite is required to create the database file.
